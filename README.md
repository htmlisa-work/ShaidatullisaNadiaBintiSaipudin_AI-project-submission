# Employee Sentiment Analysis

## 📍 Project Introduction

This project analyzes an unlabeled dataset of employee messages to assess sentiment and engagement.  
Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, exploratory data analysis (EDA), employee scoring and ranking, flight risk detection, and predictive modeling,  
I transformed raw communication data into actionable insights.

The goal is to help organizations understand employee sentiment trends, identify potential problem areas, recognize top performers,  
and proactively address retention risks through data-driven insights.
